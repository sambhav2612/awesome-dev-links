Contributions are welcome via PRs. Contributors to this repository are expected to follow and abide by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sambhav2612/awesome-dev-links/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) defined within the repo.

Please note that **the `master` branch is protected** by default hence every PR must go through atleast one review from our end (done by AccessLint for finding any accessbility issues in the pull request and) by the assigned/added contributors and maintainers of this repository. Also, the PR checks (see above) need to be passed in order to be  merged with the `master` branch. 

To add new links, go the `add-new-links` branch from root of repo a.k.a. `master` and add each link sequentially *(while appending)* one after another to prevent from merge conflicts and hence allowing us to rebase. Contributions are expected to come using the following template:

`* [LINK-TEXT](LINK)`

If you could, add something in brackets after the link text such as guide/video series/youtube playlist-channel/github gist series, etc. This would help a new user to understand the repo. Therefore, any link without anything in brackets => () would come under articles.  

***Any violation of the above rules/suggestions would directly result in immediate rejection of the pull request from the repo to be even considered for merging, howsoever or whatsoever great links it had.***

We'd try our best to moderate and merge reviewed PRs to the `master` branch by the EOD of each week or earliest if necessary or possible. 

Thank you for visiting this repo. You're a champ and a braveheart.

Happy Hunting!
