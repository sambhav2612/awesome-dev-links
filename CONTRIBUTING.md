Contributions are welcome via PRs. However, note that **the `master` is protected** by default hence every PR has to go through atleast 
one review by the assigned/added contributors and maintainers of this repository. Also, the PR checks need to be passed in order to be 
merged with `master`.

Happy Hunting!
