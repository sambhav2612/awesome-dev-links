Contributions are welcome via PRs. However, note that **the `master` is protected** by default hence every PR has to go through atleast 
one review by the assigned/added contributors and maintainers of this repository. Also, the PR checks need to be passed in order to be 
merged with `master`. 

To add new links, go the `add-new-links` branch from `master` and add each link sequentially *(append)* one after another to prevent from merge conflicts and hence rebase using the following template:

`* [LINK-TEXT](LINK)`

I'd try my best to moderate and merge reviewed PRs to the `master` branch by the EOD of each week. 

Thank you for visiting this repo. You're a champ and a braveheart.

Happy Hunting!
